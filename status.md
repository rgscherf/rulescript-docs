# Project Status

RuleScript is in active development. 

Current and past versions of the RuleScript compiler can be downloaded from [the official site](https://rulescript.org), and you can always test-drive the latest version of RuleScript [in your browser](https://rulescript.org/try).

RuleScript is at the alpha stage; that means language features are subject to change at any time. If you're using the offline compiler, you can always stay on you current version until youâ€™re ready to upgrade. 

RuleScript is rapidly being updated in response to user feedback. Get in touch with suggested improvements!
