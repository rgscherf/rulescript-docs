# Introduction

RuleScript is a computer language designed to minimize the time you spend on certain types of repetitive policy-validation tasks. Specifically, RuleScript’s goal is to automate business processes where an input document must be checked against a given set of criteria.

If part of your job involves accepting or rejecting documents in reference to government or corporate policy, it’s likely that RuleScript can save you some time.

RuleScript’s guiding principle is that it should be easy to learn. You can learn to write RuleScript in less than an hour, *and learn to read it in less than a minute*. Although it’s simple, RuleScript is powerful: it’s possible to fully define policies in terms of RuleScript, without a set of English-language guidelines.

I hope you find this guide helpful. If you get stuck or want more information about implmenting RuleScript at your organization, feel free to reach out to me on twitter [@rgscherf](https://twitter.com/rgscherf).
